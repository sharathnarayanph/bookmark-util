This extension is useful for automating the organization of bookmarks. Moving bookmarks to respective folders (sometimes nested very deep) can become tedious. This extension provides options for configuring keywords and the respective folders where these bookmarks should reside. Once a bookmark is saved, this tool efficiently detects the corresponding folder where it should reside and moves it automatically. The entire operation is seamlessly carried out in the background and the users do not face any hindrance.

Options:

1. Folder - Name of the folder where the bookmarks need to be placed (use "/" to create nested folders. Eg. home/folder/subfolder) 

2. Keywords - The keywords which would trigger the movement to the respective folder (Enter multiple keywords separated by comma                         Eg. quora, reddit, twitter)
